## General Information
This application was created to connect students with their university's faculty memebers. 
With that in mind, this web application is geared only to the faculty side of the equation, while the sister mobile application deals with the student side.
Faculty are able to upload events that can be atteneded by the students as a way of keeping in touch with them. 
This web application also gives faculty ways to chat directly with students and look at tables and charts that can help show student trends. 
Often times alumni go completely out of contact once they graduate, but the app gives the school a way to see how they are doing and in 
turn how they did as professors.
